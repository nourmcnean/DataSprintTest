# DataSprintTest
In this projest we worked with NYC Taxi Trips database. Taxi Trips data in New York City were devided seperately for each year from 2009 to 2012.
this data was accompanied with Vendor Lookup: Taxi Service Company Data  and Payment Lookup: Map between prefixes and actual payment types.

the columns are :

vendor_id, pickup_datetime, dropoff_datetime, passenger_count,
trip_distance, pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, rate_code,
store_and_fwd_flag, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude,
payment_type, fare_amount, surcharge, tip_amount,
tolls_amount and total_amount.

These are the tasks demanded: 

1. What is the average distance traveled by trips with a maximum of 2 passengers; 
1. Which are the 3 biggest vendors based on the total amount of money raised; 
1. Make a histogram of the monthly distribution over 4 years of rides paid with cash; 
1. Make a time series chart computing the number of tips each day for the last 3 months of 2012.
